Version 2.0 marks is the first patch where SmartBuyer can be deemed functional and suitable for usage, with several major
features being added.  The major update was performed on the categorical table, commonly referred to as 'cattable' within the
project.  The elements within 'cattable' track data for a broad amount of listings have been updated to include
traditional variables such as the total number of times a listing have been seen, the average price for a given type of listing, 
as well as more dynamic variables such as the predicted price variance of a type of listing and how easy it may be to sell 
said type of listing, quantified by the variables profitability and marketability respectively.

entries, minimizing the number of times the table needs to be updated.  The process can be further optimizied by updating a 
single row on the table with accordance to a new entry, and will likely be implemented in a future patch.

significantly more thorough and gives a user a greater sense of what is occuring during the search.  Furthermore, it is easy to 
distinguish when the software is getting a lot of good results, or if the constraints need to be changed to search for more
items.
