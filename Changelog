Changelog

v1.1.0
2/20/2015
Minimizes search redundancies to prevent checks on item listings that have already been checked.  This is done via tracking the
ID of the first searched item and referencing it against future search checks (e.x. If the program has previously searched items A through F, then 
if it does research A, it knows that subsequent searches have already been parsed). A second table on PostgreSQL stores the information regarding
the search ID the software is to lookout for. The same reference table is likely to be used for other measures to improve performance 
in future versions.
